End-to-End LLM Project Using LLAMA 2: Generating Topic-Specific Blogs

This project leverages the open-source LLAMA 2 model from Meta to develop a comprehensive, end-to-end system for generating high-quality blog posts on user-specified topics. The system features a user-friendly interface where users can input their desired blog topics. The backend, powered by LLAMA 2, processes these inputs to generate coherent, informative, and engaging blog content.
